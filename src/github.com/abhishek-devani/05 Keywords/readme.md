# Keywords in Go

1. **break:**

3. **func:**
   - Used to declare a function.
4. **interface:**
   - Used to declare a set of method signatures that a type must implement to be considered as implementing that interface.
5. **select:**
   - Used to wait on multiple communication operations. It is often used with channels.
6. **case:**
   - Used in a `switch` statement to define different conditions and associated code blocks.
7. **defer:**
   - Used to schedule a function call to be run after the function completes. Useful for cleanup actions.
8. **go:**
   - Used to start a new goroutine, a lightweight thread of execution.
9.  **map:**
    - Used to declare and create a map, a collection of key-value pairs. 
10. **struct:**
    - Used to define a structure (composite type) that groups together variables under a single name.
11. **chan:**
    - Used to declare and create a channel, a communication mechanism between goroutines.
12. **else:**
    - Used in an `if` statement to specify the code to be executed if the condition is false.
13. **goto:**
    - Used to transfer control to a labeled statement in the program. Generally discouraged in modern Go code.
14. **package:**

16. **const:**
    - Used to declare constants.
17. **failthrough:**

18. **if:**
    - Used to make decisions based on the evaluation of a condition.
19. **range:**
    - Used in a `for` loop to iterate over elements in an array, slice, string, map, or channel.
20. **type:**
    - Used to declare a new type or alias.
21. **continue:**
    - Used to skip the rest of the loop body and start the next iteration.
22. **for:**
    - Used to create loops. It can be used in various forms, such as `for condition`, `for initialization`; `condition`; `post`, and `for range`.
23. **import:**
